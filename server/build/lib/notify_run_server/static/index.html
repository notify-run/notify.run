    <strong>notify.run</strong> lets you send notifications to your own phone or desktop with minimal fuss. This is primarily useful
    for tracking the progress of long-running compute jobs.
</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<div class="ui segment" id="quickstart" style="min-height: 120px;">
    <p>Using this service requires JavaScript to be enabled.</p>
</div>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>Each user of notify.run is assigned a
    <strong>channel</strong>, identified by a random string. Devices which support the
    <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=push-api">Web Push API</a>, including Chrome and Firefox for desktop and Android, can subscribe to notifications on a channel and
    show a pop-up notification. Other devices, such as iOS Safari, do not yet support the API needed for background notifications,
    but they can still be used to see a list of recent notifications.
</p>

<p>
    Each channel has its own HTTP(S) endpoint. When you
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST</a> a message to that endpoint, notify.run relays it to every subscription on that channel.
</p>
<p>
    notify.run uses standard APIs for both sending and subscribing to notifications, which means that it can be used without
    installling any software. If you prefer, you can use the command-line tool and Python package to simplify integration
    with your workflow.</p>

<h2>Integrations</h2>

<h3>Command-line interface</h3>

<p>
    The command-line interface and Python API are part of the
    <samp>notify-run</samp> Python package. You can install both using the
    <samp>pip</samp> package manager
</p>

<pre>pip install notify-run</pre>

<p>
    Once it has been installed, you can register a new channel like so:
</p>

<pre>notify-run register</pre>

<p>
    Alternatively, you can configure it to use a channel that already exists:
</p>

<pre>notify-run configure https://notify.run/<strong>[channel name]</strong></pre>

<p>
    The configuration is stored in the
    <samp>~/.config/notify-run</samp> file in your home directory. It will be picked up by subsequent runs of
    <samp>notify-run</samp> as well as the
    <samp>notify_run</samp>
    Python module.
</p>

<h3>Jupyter</h3>

<p>When used inside a Jupyter notebook, the subscribe link is clickable and a QR code is displayed.
</p>

<h3>Keras</h3>

<p>Notify includes a callback for
    <a href="https://keras.io">Keras</a> which sends a progress notification at the end of each epoch. After configuring an endpoint above, import
    <samp>NotifyCallback</samp> from
    <samp>notify_run.keras</samp> and pass it in the callback parameter to a Keras
    <samp>fit</samp> method.</p>

<pre>from notify_run.keras import NotifyCallback
# model is a Keras model that you have created elsewhere.
model.fit(x, y, callbacks=[NotifyCallback()])</pre>

<h2>Self-hosting</h2>

<p>
    This public instance is freely provided for your convenience, but does not have an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">SLA</a>
    and should not be used for notification messages containing private data. For more demanding use cases, you may prefer to
    run your own instance of the server on your own network.
</p>
<p>
    Self-hosting is currently not documented, but have a look at
    <a href="https://github.com/paulgb/notify.run/tree/master/server">the files here</a>
    and feel free to reach out to me for guidance.
